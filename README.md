# Tutorials Repository

This repository contains code snippets that accompany my YouTube video tutorials about Zoho development and automation. Here you'll find examples of custom Deluge scripts, API implementations, and various solutions that I've demonstrated in my videos.

## About Me

I am Gregory Moulton the founder of [ZE Partner](https://zepartner.net). I am a certified Zoho Developer and Zoho Expert with a passion for helping businesses optimize and automate their operations using the Zoho suite of applications. My journey with Zoho started in 2018 when I sought to automate tasks for my real estate business. The transformation was so profound that I eventually sold my business in 2022 to focus full-time on helping others achieve the same success with Zoho.

My services include:
- Zoho consulting
- System design and implementation
- Tutorial support sessions
- CRM setup
- Connections between Zoho and non-Zoho applications
- Custom functions in Deluge Script

With my experience, you can:
- Save Time
- Reduce/Eliminate Human Error
- Increase Sales
- Automate Repetitive Tasks
- Increase Professionalism
